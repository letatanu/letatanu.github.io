<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PhD student of Computer Science at Lehigh University, advised by Prof. [Maryam Rahnemoonfar]("https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/maryam-rahnemoonfar"). My current research  interest lies in deep learning and computer vision, and their application in 3D reconstruction, 3D rendering and 3D semantic segmentation.

Previously, I had been working as a 3D computer vision engineer at [Sturfee, Inc.]("https://sturfee.com/") for three years. My work focused on 3D reconstruction and 3D localization to improve the performance and accuracy of Visual Positioning System (VPS). I received my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science at Portland State University.
