<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Lehigh University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/maryam-rahnemoonfar">Maryam Rahnemoonfar</a>. My current research  interest lies in deep learning and computer vision, and their application in 3D reconstruction, 3D rendering and 3D semantic segmentation.

Previously, I had been working as a 3D computer vision engineer at <a href="https://sturfee.com/">Sturfee, Inc.</a> for three years. My work focused on 3D reconstruction and 3D localization to improve the performance and accuracy of Visual Positioning System (VPS). I received my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science at Portland State University.
